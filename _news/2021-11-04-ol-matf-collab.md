Faculty of Mathematics is collaborating with [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/) through MSc and PhD research programs and internships. I have held a joint presentation about [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) with other researchers at the Faculty's [seminar](http://computing.matf.bg.ac.rs/). The entire presentation (in Serbian) can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhH4Q6O0Hg).
