This website is now accessible from [matf.ristovic.net](https://matf.ristovic.net) in addition to the faculty server at [poincare.math.rs/~ivan\_ristovic](https://poincare.math.rs/~ivan_ristovic) and GitHub Pages. Additionally, I have provided several e-mail addresses that you can use to contact me:

E-mails targetting [ivan\_ristovic@math.rs](mailto://ivan_ristovic@math.rs) should be forwarded automatically to [matf@ristovic.net](mailto://matf@ristovic.net), however please notify me if I haven't replied as your e-mail might have been misplaced by the faculty mail server.
