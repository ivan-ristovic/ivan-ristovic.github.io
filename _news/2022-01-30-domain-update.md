This website is now accessible from [matf.ristovic.net](https://matf.ristovic.net) in addition to the faculty server at [poincare.math.rs/~ivan\_ristovic](https://poincare.math.rs/~ivan_ristovic) and GitHub Pages. Additionally, I have provided several e-mail addresses that you can use to contact me using the `ristovic.net` domain:
- `contact`, for general contact
- `matf`, for MATF related conversations
- `edu`, for general education conversations
- `work`, for non-education related work conversations

E-mails targetting [ivan\_ristovic@math.rs](mailto://ivan_ristovic@math.rs) should be forwarded automatically to the `matf` address. Please notify me if I don't reply, as your e-mail might have been misplaced by the faculty mail server.
