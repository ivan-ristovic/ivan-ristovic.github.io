    <p>
        Teaching assistant trainee at Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade.
    </p>
    <p>
        I specialize mainly in C#, C and C++, but I can work in Java and Python very well. Some of my selected projects include
        faculty projects such as team-building applications and papers. I also like to explore on my own, mainly creating
        stuff for platforms/apps that I use at the time. I publish all of my projects to GitHub, so feel free to check them out!

    <h1> Short bio </h1>
    <p>
        I was born in 1995 in Užice, Serbia and there I have finished primary and high school. In 2014 I started the 
        Undergraduate studies at the Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade. Momentarily after graduation in 2017 I 
        started the Master Degree studies. In 2018 I was selected for an open Teaching Assistant Trainee position 
        at the aforementioned faculty - where I remain until today.

    <p>
        In my free time I enjoy computer games (who doesn't?), snooker, tennis, board games (Chess, Othello).
