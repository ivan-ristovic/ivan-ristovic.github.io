    <h1>Ivan Ristović</h1>
    <p>
        I am a software developer with too many hobbies - mostly interested in software development, algorithms and mathematics behind it all. I work as a teaching assistant at Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for my programming skills, I specialize mainly in C#, C++ and C, but I can work in Java and Python very well. Some of my projects include faculty-related projects such as team-building applications and research papers. I also like to explore on my own, mainly creating stuff for platforms or apps that I use at the time. I publish (almost) all of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github }}" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, so feel free to check them out!

    <h1> Short bio </h1>
    <p>
        I was born in 1995 in Užice, Serbia and there I have finished primary and high school with excellent grades. In 2014 I started the Undergraduate studies at the Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade which I have finished in three years. Momentarily after graduation I started the Master Degree studies which I have finished in summer of 2020. In the fall of 2020 I have started the PhD studies at the Faculty of Mathematics. During my MSc studies I was selected for an open Teaching Assistant Trainee position in the Department of Computer Science, and in 2020 I have been promoted to a Teaching Assistant position at the same department. I hold practices from <a href="courses.html">various courses</a> in the latter years of studies.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time I enjoy computer games (who doesn't?), motorsport (primarily rally), board games (Chess, Othello), snooker, tennis.
