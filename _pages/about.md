I am a passionate programmer with too many hobbies. My interests include modern software development and verification, functional and network programming, and programming language implementations. I specialize in .NET, C# and Java, currently working on large-scale projects such as [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/).

I teach various courses as a member of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.racunarstvo.matf.bg.ac.rs/) at the [Faculty of Mathematics](http://www.matf.bg.ac.rs/eng/) in Belgrade, and I am doing research on GraalVM and GraalOS at [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/).

In my free time I enjoy computer games (who doesn't?), motorsport (primarily rally), board games (Chess, Othello), snooker, tennis.
