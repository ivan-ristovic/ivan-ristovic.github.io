<h1>Virtual appliances</h1>
  <p>
    In order to follow my courses, I have created a prebuilt virtual appliance which has everything nececary already set up. This appliance can be used for a variety of other courses with minimal or no modifications and therefore students are free to install or modify this appliance to suit their needs. Account passwords match the account names.
