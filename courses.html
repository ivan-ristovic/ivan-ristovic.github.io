<h1>Virtual applicances</h1>
  <p>
    In order to follow materials for all my courses, I advise to use a prebuilt virtual appliance which has everything already set up. This appliance can be used for a variety of other courses with minimal or no modifications and therefore you are free to install or modify this appliance to suit your needs. Passwords for the accounts are the same as the account name.
